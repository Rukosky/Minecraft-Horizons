# Minecraft-Horizons
An expansion pack designed to redefine Minecraft and reignite the player's passion to explore the world.

This modpack runs on Quilt 1.19.2, which allows all Quilt and Fabric related mods. Prism Launcher is recommended to play, as all you have to do is drag and drop the file onto the window and run the modpack, but MultiMC and ATLauncher are also supported.
